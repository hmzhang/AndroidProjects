Developed in Eclipse, the app consists of 4 sections:
 - A notifications list: add important tasks that you need to do later on

 This was an initial Android project to help me learn the basics of Android.

EDIT: Current converting project from Eclipse to Android Studio, and also updating the user interface so that everything looks better, and fixing the functionality of some sections.
